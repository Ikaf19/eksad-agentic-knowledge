# MCP Profile — qa-engineer

## Intent

QA Engineer may use OpenAPI, Playwright, CI evidence, and selected read-only schema/event/observability evidence.

## Source of truth

- `portable/roles/qa-engineer.md` when present.
- `portable/mcp/role-mcp-matrix.md`.
- `mcp/servers/*/manifest.json`.

## Runtime rule

A runtime may expose only MCP capabilities allowed or optional for this role. Optional capabilities require task justification.

## Chatbot mode

In GPT Project / Claude Project, this file is policy reference only. Ask the user for evidence instead of assuming tool access.

## Agentic mode

In Hermes or another agentic harness, use server manifests to render runtime config and apply only after approval.
